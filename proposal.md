PROPOSAL:

* Project title: Nerf blaster

* Team members: Grace Hu, Steffi Andersen, Michael Oduoza

* Description: Our project consists of a nerf gun that detects a target and rotates
to shoot the target.  To track the target, there will be IR sensors.  We will use
servo motors to rotate the gun on a stand, and have a motor trigger mechanism.  If
there is time, extended features will include a display that maps out the guns location
and the targets location, as well as displays ammunition left.  

* Hardware required (itemize what hardware, if any, you need)
    Nerf gun
    2 motors- gear and servo
    12 IR sensors
    Plate
    3D printed arm stand
    Screws, gears
    Milk Crate

* Funds requested: $60
    $15- nerf gun
    $20- motor
    $10- gears/electronics
    $15- stand/support system for nerf gun

* Major task breakdown and who is responsible for each task
    Michael- sensors
    Steffi- trigger system
    Grace- mechanical assembly

* Goals for next week
    All of hardware working, gun stand built, sensors attached, trigger system built
