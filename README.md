## Overview
The goal of a project was to develop an **automated nerf gun** that can **track a target** and **capture video.**.   The gun can be operated using two modes: “auto” and “interactive.”

Auto mode

A Nerf Dart Zone Titan was used due to its ability to automatically reload darts, and ultrasonic sensors were used to track motion.  An arducam was used to capture the video of the target. 

Below, each component is described in detail:

## Hardware
The nerf gun is mounted on a rotating platform.  3D printed arms hold the gun, and adhesives anchor it in place.  A base made of foam poster board is rotated by a servo motor, powered by () V.
